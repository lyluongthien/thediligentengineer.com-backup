On March 29, 2023, I had the pleasure of hosting a dynamic presentation at Groove Technology, unveiling insights on how to expedite development processes using the NX Build System.

The session delved into strategies and practices aimed at accelerating development within our team. By harnessing the capabilities of the NX Build System, we explored avenues to enhance efficiency and streamline workflows for optimal outcomes.

For those eager to revisit the key highlights or for those who couldn't attend, the presentation slides are accessible here.

I look forward to the positive impact this knowledge can have on our development endeavors at GT and encourage everyone to explore the materials shared for further enrichment.
