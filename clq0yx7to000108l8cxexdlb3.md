On September 8, 2022, I had the privilege of presenting a cutting-edge Javascript and Typescript compiler to my team at TIKI. Allow me to introduce SWC, a revolutionary high-performance compiler crafted in Rust, boasting a customizable plugin API. This innovation has the potential to bring about significant improvements in the development experience (DX).

The SWC compiler, being written in Rust, ensures not only robustness but also efficiency, paving the way for a smoother and more productive development process. During the presentation at Tiki Co., Ltd. ([tiki.vn](http://tiki.vn)), I showcased the compiler's capabilities and demonstrated how it could elevate our development workflows.

For those eager to delve deeper into SWC, I encourage you to explore the comprehensive documentation available at [swc.rs](https://swc.rs). It provides an in-depth understanding of the compiler's features and functionalities, offering a valuable resource for leveraging its full potential.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to the positive impact that SWC can bring to our development endeavors.
