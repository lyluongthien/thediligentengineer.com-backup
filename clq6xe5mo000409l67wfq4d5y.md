On November 10, 2022, I had the privilege of conducting an insightful workshop on "Garbage Collection and Memory Leaks in Node.js V8" at  [TIKI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tiki-vn/). The session aimed to deepen our understanding of these critical aspects, shedding light on best practices and strategies to optimize performance.
