> After watching [Chloe's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ILCCMbhCW4) on this topic, I decided to write this post as a write-up to take notes about what she shared and what makes me interested.

In today's fast-paced world, the ability to ask the right questions is becoming increasingly important, especially in leadership roles. As an engineer, understanding and applying the art of asking smarter questions can significantly impact our problem-solving abilities and strategic decision-making processes.

## The Shift from Answers to Questions

Traditionally, the focus has been on having the right answers. However, advancements in technology and the complexity of modern problems necessitate a shift towards prioritizing the right questions. This transition is crucial for developing innovative solutions and ensuring robust strategies in the face of evolving challenges.

## Categories of Strategic Questions

According to a study by IMD Business School, as highlighted in the Harvard Business Review article "The Art of Asking Smarter Questions," strategic questions can be categorized into five main types: investigative, speculative, productive, interpretive, and subjective. Each category serves a unique purpose in the decision-making process.

### Investigative Questions

These questions, such as "What do we know?", help in identifying and clarifying existing information. For instance, the failure of the French railway company SNCF to account for the dimensions of regional train stations while purchasing new trains led to significant financial and operational setbacks. Investigative questions would have highlighted these critical details early on, preventing costly mistakes​ ([Railway Technology](https://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsfrances-sncf-orders-2000-new-trains-that-are-too-wide-4274382/))​​ ([HuffPost UK](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/21/trains-too-wide-for-platforms_n_5363781.html)).

### Speculative Questions

Speculative questions, like "What if?", allow leaders to explore different scenarios and potential outcomes. When a team lacks motivation, asking "What if we organize a retreat?" versus "What if we replace the team members?" can lead to vastly different strategies with distinct implications for team morale and project success.

### Productive Questions

Productive questions focus on implementation and efficiency. Examples include "How can we get it done?" and "How will we measure progress?". The LEGO Group's experience in the early 2000s serves as a cautionary tale. Rapid diversification without considering resource alignment and performance metrics led to substantial losses. Productive questions could have ensured better synchronization and tracking of initiatives.

### Interpretive Questions

Interpretive questions, such as "So what?", help in understanding the deeper implications of findings and ideas. For example, during the development of a new electric vehicle, Tesla’s engineers could have benefited from asking interpretive questions to foresee the long-term impact and market potential, rather than focusing solely on technical flaws.

### Subjective Questions

Subjective questions, like "What’s unsaid?", address personal and emotional factors that might affect decision-making. The British Airways rebranding effort in 1997 ignored employee and customer sentiments, leading to dissatisfaction and brand disloyalty. Acknowledging these subjective elements could have guided more inclusive and effective strategies.

## Balancing Question Types for Effective Leadership

To become more effective decision-makers, it is crucial to balance these types of questions. Assessing one's questioning style, incorporating diverse questions in discussions, and leveraging team strengths to cover blind spots are essential steps.

In conclusion, mastering the art of asking smarter questions can transform how engineers lead and innovate by focusing on the right questions, we can uncover deeper insights, develop more strategic solutions, and drive meaningful progress in our projects and organizations.

* **SNCF Train Dimensions Mistake**:
    
    * French railway operator SNCF ordered new trains that were too wide for many regional platforms due to incorrect dimensions provided by RFF. The error, discovered after the order, resulted in a costly modification of platforms to accommodate the trains ([Railway Technology](https://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsfrances-sncf-orders-2000-new-trains-that-are-too-wide-4274382/)) ([HuffPost UK](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/21/trains-too-wide-for-platforms_n_5363781.html)).
        
* **NASA Metric Conversion Error**:
    
    * NASA's $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter was lost in 1999 due to a metric conversion error. Engineers at Lockheed Martin used imperial units instead of metric units, leading to the spacecraft's incorrect trajectory and subsequent destruction in the Martian atmosphere ([WSP](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/space/stories/orbiter100199.htm#:~:text=NASA's%20Mars%20Climate%20Orbiter%20was,Martian%20surface%2C%20investigators%20said%20yesterday.)).
        
* **Vasa Warship Sinking**:
    
    * The Swedish warship Vasa sank on its maiden voyage in 1628 due to design flaws. It was top-heavy with insufficient ballast, causing it to capsize just minutes after setting sail (Vasa Museum) (History).
        
* **Hubble Space Telescope Flaw**:
    
    * The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, initially produced blurry images because of a flaw in its primary mirror. The issue was corrected in 1993 by a Space Shuttle mission that installed corrective optics ([NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html)) (Space).
        
* **Hilton's Hong Kong Hotel Incident**:
    
    * In 1975, the newly opened Hilton Hotel in Hong Kong had to close temporarily due to a plumbing error. The hotel’s plumbing system was connected incorrectly, resulting in sewage backing up into the drinking water supply (Hilton Archives) (SCMP).
        
* **Ariane 5 Rocket Failure**:
    
    * In 1996, the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket exploded shortly after launch due to a software error. A 64-bit number related to the rocket’s velocity was incorrectly converted to a 16-bit number, causing an overflow and subsequent failure (ESA) (BBC).
        
* **Berlin Brandenburg Airport Delays**:
    
    * The opening of Berlin Brandenburg Airport was delayed by nearly a decade due to a series of design and construction flaws. Issues included fire safety system failures, wiring problems, and poor planning (DW) ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/nov/15/the-strange-story-of-berlins-ber-airport-how-overspending-incompetence-and-catastrophe-delayed-its-opening)).
        
* **The Walkie-Talkie Building's Reflections**:
    
    * London's Walkie-Talkie skyscraper, completed in 2014, inadvertently focused sunlight onto the streets below, causing damage to parked cars and other objects. The building’s curved design acted as a concave mirror, leading to the problem ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-23930675)) ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/02/london-skyscraper-melts-car)).
        
* **Millennium Bridge Wobble**:
    
    * London’s Millennium Bridge, opened in 2000, experienced unexpected swaying due to pedestrian-induced vibrations. The bridge was closed for modifications to add dampers that stabilized its movement (BBC) ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/22/hilaryclarke)).
        
* **Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse**:
    
    * The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which opened in 1940, collapsed four months later due to an aeroelastic flutter caused by wind. The failure was a result of insufficient consideration of aerodynamic forces in the design (History) (ASCE).
